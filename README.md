# icowatchlist-api
A semi useful hack together of icowatchlist's data for a tool I'm working on for security related things for ico's.
I wrote this fast never planned a public release but why not incase its actually needed as I couldnt find one.

Also note it wasnt optimized at all may not be very pythonic, so if You see an issue please request a update.
